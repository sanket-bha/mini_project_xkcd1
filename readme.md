## linux commands

- `pwd` - present working directory
- `cd <directory-name>` 
- `ls -la` - everything including hidden folders

# git configuration

```markdown
# system configurations

System-wide configurations when you install git software in your machine.
Typically, on linux it lies under `/etc/gitconfig`.
On windows it could be `c:\\program-files\\` or something similar (you can check).

# global configurations

This is again System-wide configuration.
Typically, on linux it lies under `~/gitconfig`.
On windows, it could be `C:\Users\$USER` (you can check).

We will configure our user name and email using commands -

`$ git config --global user.name "prashant"`
`$ git config --global user.email prashant@gmail.com`


# local configurations

when you run `git init` command, a hidden directory with name `.git` should be 
created. This is the directory that contains all your git configurations 
particular to your project (locally).

If you want to remove git tracking from your project, you can delete this `.git`
folder completely.
```

```shell
## global configs

git config --global user.name "prashant"
git config --global user.email "prashant@gmail.com"

## verify git config
git config --list
```

```shell

# First navigate to your project directory / folder
# And then run following commands

# STEP 1 : Open terminal (`cd` to project root)
git init

# STEP 2: check of status of git repository
git status

# STEP 3: to add files in staging area (to track)
git add <file-name>

# STEP 4: create a file `.gitignore`

# STEP 5: run following command *only if* un-necessary files are not reflecting
# in `git status` command
git add --all

# STEP 6: whenever you run git commit all files under staging area are commited and
# certain unique "commit-id" is generated (`SHA1`).
git commit -m "<commit-message>"

# STEP 7: run git log to see commit id and commit message history
git log

# STEP 7: copy https URL from github and paste 
git remote add origin https://github.com/python10sep/mini_xkcd.git

# STEP 8:
git push -u origin master
```


# `git` documentation

- what is `staging area`?
```
    The staging area can be described as a preview of your next commit. When you
    create a git commit, Git takes changes that are in the staging area and make
    them as a new commit. You are allowed to add and remove changes from the staging
    area. The staging area can be considered as a real area where git stores the
    changes.
```

- `git init` - initializes project to git. Basically this command will create 
local git configurations. It tells `git` that this is the code repository we need
to "track" changes in.

- `git add` - adds the files into `staging area`. It basically prepares files for
to be committed. Meaning, its part of preparation for 
versioning.

- `git status` - feel free to run this command a ton times! 
This command is always a good idea. This command shows you what branch you're on, 
what files are in the staging area, what files git is tracking and any other 
important information.

- `git commit` - Records file version permanently in version history.

- `git commit -m "descriptive message"` - elaborated version of `git commit` 
command where you can provide your own "custom" message against
a particular commit.

- `git log` - Browse history of changes and inspect the evolution of project files.

- `git remote add origin <https-url-copied-from-github>`
We can add associated remote repository against label called `origin`.
We can create multiple such labels like `origin`.
`origin` is just a popular label used to represent remote URL.

- **NOTE** -
Don't be confused.
Here `remote repository` means the repository we created on `github.com`
